    This version: Add choices as function dictionary

## Week 07 files
    
    Initially I had difficulty opening files without using absolute paths in the open()function. From 7-1 studentManagementProgram.py and going forwayd
    I will use os.path and sys functions to get the file path so files can be run from the same directory on any system.


### 7_a_readAfile-extension.py

    A program tha will read a file an count how many times
    it has been run. It will do this by saving incrementing the count in separate file. 
    The program will open the file, read the file and write to the file
    The program will also test to see if the file it exists, if it does not it will create it with a '0' writer

### 7_json_1_read.py
    A file with opens a json file with an existing dictionary to demontrate how json can read from a dictionary file structure from a json file


### 7_json_1_write.py
    A file with opens a json file to demontrate how a json file can be used to store a dictionary file structure

### 7-1 studentManagementProgram.py
    extended version of week 6 student management program. This program now reads and writes the student list (and its dictionaries) to a json file.
    it also uses accesses the system path for the file open function as on this system there were problems
